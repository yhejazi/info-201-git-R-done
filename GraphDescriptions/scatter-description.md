### Notes on the Scatter Plot
- This is a scatter plot displaying data on the restaurants listed in Yelp that reside in Washington State. 
- This visualization compares each category of food of interest by the average price of all restaurants to the average rating. 
- This represents an **average** and is not meant to accurately compare which types of food are most likely cheaper or better. 
- Only **300** restaurant Yelp entries out of 302 in Washington State are included in this data. Furthermore, _not all restaurants are accounted for_ in Yelp. While the restaurants listed on Yelp can be argued as most popular,  the categories may still be misrepresented.

### Findings
Comparing **categories of food** and their attributes of **average price** and **average rating** within Washington State can lead to the following observations:

- Korean food, an outlier within the data, is shown to be, on average, the cheapest option with the highest rating.
- Japanese, Thai, and Mexican are also highly rated categories, but tend to be almost a whole level pricier.
- Chinese food is shown to be the type of food with the lowest average rating.
- Italian food is observed to be the priciest option. 

A small trend can be found showing a group of higher-rated categories leaning towards the cheaper end, and a group of lower-rated categories near the pricier end. While outliers show, we can make conclusions from this trend that people from Washington tend to rate cheaper restaurants more highly on average. This can communicate information on Washington residents' values or the role of socioeconomic status.
