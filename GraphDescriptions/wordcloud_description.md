### Purpose and Method
The word clouds are used to compare the differences in how restaurants of various ethnicity choose the names of their restaurants.  The data comes from the Yelp API, extracting up to 200 entries for each type of restaurants located in **Washington**.  Duplicate restaurant names are filtered out to prevent popular franchises from dominating the word clouds.  This data is a good indicator for showing the type of words that restaurants use to promote what they serve.

### Observations
- To no surprise, many restaurants tend to use the word "restaurant" as a part of its name, as it is a straight forward way of advertising what service they provide.

- Many restaurants often include the names of the countries that their food originated from. For example, Japanese restaurants would have "Japanese" or "Japan" as a part of their names.  Well-known cities from the corresponding countries are also included, such as "Seoul" for Korean restaurants and "Shanghai" for Chinese restaurants.

- Names of well-known foods from certain countries are often included in restaurants that serve cuisines from those countries.  The word "Pizza" is used **very** commonly for Italian restaurants, as well as "Sushi" for Japanese restaurants.

- There aren't any particularly popular food in the names of traditional American restaurants. Instead, what seems to be more common are names that describe the *setting* of the restaurants, such as "bar", "pub", and "cafe".
