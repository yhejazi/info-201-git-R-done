Overall our data reavealed a number of interesting insights regarding the types of food favored in different areas of the United States. One such insight gained was the specific type of food that each state rated the highest based on the top 50 resturants for each category in the most populated city of that state. *(For example, Mediterranean food gained the highest average ratings in Seattle)*. The top 50 resturantes were automatically choosen by Yelp's sort_by(best_fit) function.

The map below shows which state rated which type of food the highest based on the **most populated city** of that state (excluding German beacause there were too few options to show). The colors are seperated by cuisine type while the size of the bubbles represents the overall average rating. The table beneath it similarly shows which food was rated the highest by state shown in alphabetical order.
