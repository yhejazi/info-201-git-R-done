## Inferences  

#### Why no American?
One interesting find from this chart is the fact that no state had American as it's top rated food type. This could possibly be because a majority of American food is classified as fast food which tends to be rated lower or not at all. Interestingly, when we crossed this data with the average obesity rates in each state as an experiment, we found no correlation between the [average adult obesity](http://stateofobesity.org/adult-obesity/) rate and the type of food that was rated the highest. Our guess is that the overall popularity of American food across the country means that customers are more picky which equals lower reveiws.   

#### Mediterranean gets good Ratings!
Mediterranean food was shown to be favored in **13** of the **50** states which our group found to be surprising, especially because Seattle's own top rated food choice was Mediterranean.  

#### The Location Factor
There appears to be no real trend in location and highest rated food type, howver Mexican food is predictably highest rated in the southwest united states while Italian is  popular in the northeast united states. Japanese food was also rated highly in Las Vegas and in Hawaii which similarly did not come as a surprise because Las Vegas is known for it's high quality restaurant scene and because Hawaii is known for it's fresh fish centered culture (although it did end up being surprising that Seattle did not rate Japanese food as it's highest overall rated food because Seattle is known for having a strong Japanese cultural influence.) This goes to show that **quantity or popularity of a certain cuisine in a city does not necessarily mean that that cuisine gets the highest ratings.** 

#### What's up with Korean food? 
Something that came across as surprising was the fact that the highest average rating for any city (which was 5 stars) ended up being a tie for Korean food in *Little Rock, Arkansas* and Korean food in *Jackson, Mississippi*. This is likely due to the fact that there are not a significant number of Korean restaurants in these areas which means that the ones that are present tend to be upscale specialty type restaurants which encourage higher ratings. It is also possible that these resturants were rated highly because Korean food tends to be one of the cheapest options and Mississippi and Arkansas are historically two of the poorest places in the United States.
