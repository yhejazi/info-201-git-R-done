### What is Yelp? 
Yelp is essentially an online application that connects customers to local businesses by allowing them to write reviews and give ratings. Yelp's Chief Executive Officer and Co-founder, [Jeremy Stoppelman](https://www.yelpblog.com/2013/01/introducing-lives), describes Yelp's mission as a way to:

> "...connect people with great local businesses; along the way, we hope to enrich lives of consumers and small business owners. In pursuit of this mission, we want to provide the most helpful information possible about local businesses. While ratings and reviews are incredibly powerful ways to guide spending decisions, we’re always looking for new ways to supplement the information to provide a better experience for consumers"

### What is the Data?
All the data that we worked with in our project can be found at: 
https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3 

The data was gathered by [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/sf) which was founded in 2004 as a way to connect people with local businesses.
The data stems from users who choose to give the businesses they visit a rating or review. Businesses have an average rating score that ranges from 0 to 5 stars, and business owners have the option to setup a free account with Yelp in order to post photos and promote their business. 

Yelp is extremely popular and by the end of Q1 2017 there have been more than 127 million reviews written by users. According to the [Yelp website](https://www.yelp.com/about) Yelp had a monthly average of 26 million unique visitors who visited Yelp via the Yelp app and 73 million unique visitors who visited Yelp via mobile web in Q1 2017. Only 19% of all businesses that were reviewed by Yelp came from restaurants.

The Yelp api that we worked with provided us with the top 50 restaurants in the most populated city in each state sorted by what Yelp refers to as "best_match." 

This means that the rating sort is not strictly sorted by the rating value, but by an adjusted rating value that takes into account the number of ratings, similar to a [Bayesian average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_average). This is so a business with 1 rating of 5 stars doesn’t immediately jump to the top.

### What did we do?
For our project we focused on restaurants that are categorized by 9 distinct food types which include:  
* American   
* Italian   
* Mexican  
* Japanese  
* Korean  
* Indian  
* Thai  
* Mediterranean  
* German  

We chose these nine food types because of their prevalence and popularity in the United States. 
After defining our nine food types, we went to work finding trends based on a number of variables such as average price rating (which Yelp defines on a scale of 1 to 4 "$"), number of total reveiws, location, and resturant name.  

Because of the large nature of the data, we decided to focus on data from the top 150 resturants in Washington state for each food category. We ended up creating three interactive charts which can be found on the tabs at the top of this page.

The first chart is a wordcloud that shows the most popular words in each resturant name seperated by category.  
The second chart is a stacked bar chart that shows the   
The third chart is a scatterplot that shows
